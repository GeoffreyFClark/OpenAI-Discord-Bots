Created a template for an image-generating ML AI openAI discord bot. (openai_template_image_gen.py)

Added a 1700+ line training dataset of comments web-scraped from reddit (many from r/jokes) cleaned up + formatted. (tdata_slice.jsonl)

Added reinforcement functionality to one bot via basic logprobs (active_learning_bot_sanitized.py):
